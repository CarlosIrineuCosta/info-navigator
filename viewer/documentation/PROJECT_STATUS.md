# Lunar Cards Explorer - Development Status

## Project Overview
Educational card exploration game focused on lunar exploration history. Users navigate through historical facts via interactive cards with three navigation modes: Timeline, Thematic, and Random.

## ✅ FIXED: Docker MCP Issue Resolution
**Problem Identified:** The MCP filesystem was running in Docker with specific mount points:
- `/projects/devops/` → **D:\DEVOPS** (Windows accessible)
- `/projects/users/` → **C:\Users\charl** (Windows accessible)  
- `/projects/ai_images/` → **H:\___AI IMAGES** (Windows accessible)

**Solution:** Recreated entire project in `/projects/devops/lunar-cards/` which maps to **D:\DEVOPS\lunar-cards\** in Windows.

## Windows Access Path
**You can now find all files at:**
```
D:\DEVOPS\lunar-cards\
```

## Current Implementation Status ✅

## Quick Start Commands
```bash
# In VS Code terminal (WSL2 Ubuntu) OR navigate to D:\DEVOPS\lunar-cards\ in Windows
cd /path/to/D:/DEVOPS/lunar-cards  # or your equivalent path

# Activate your virtual environment
source box-i/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download NASA images (optional but recommended)
python download_images.py

# Run the application
python app.py

# Open browser to: http://localhost:5001
```

- **Visual**: Professional space-themed interface
- **Expandable**: Clean structure for content additions
- **Accessible**: Now in D:\DEVOPS where you can access all files

## Next Steps
1. Navigate to **D:\DEVOPS\lunar-cards\** in Windows Explorer
2. Copy files to your preferred WSL2 working directory if needed
3. Follow the Quick Start Commands above
4. Should be running within 15 minutes!

The Docker MCP mapping issue has been resolved - all files are now accessible at **D:\DEVOPS\lunar-cards\**.
