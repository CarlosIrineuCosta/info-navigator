# InfoNavigator PWA - Viewer Skeleton

This project is a functional skeleton for the Box_i Quiz App, built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) using React and Tailwind CSS. It's designed to be easily deployable to static hosting services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING - TODO

**URGENT**: Database structure and Builder integration changes needed:

### üîß Implemented (Ready for testing):
1. **‚úÖ Set Numbering**: Added `set_number` field (s001, s002, s003) to content_sets.json
2. **‚úÖ Card Numbering**: Added `card_number` field (c001, c002, etc.) to cards.json  
3. **‚úÖ Image Organization**: Created `/public/images/sets/{set_number}/` structure with subfolders
4. **‚úÖ Path Updates**: Updated JSON to use `./images/sets/s001/banner.jpg` format
5. **‚úÖ Fallback System**: Images gracefully fallback to placeholders if missing

### üö® Builder Integration Required:
1. **Database Structure**: See `DATABASE_STRUCTURE.md` for complete field specifications
2. **Auto-numbering**: Builder must generate `set_number` and `card_number` fields
3. **Creator ID Validation**: System must check `creator_id` availability before creation
4. **Image Path Generation**: Auto-generate paths using new numbering system
5. **Color Scheme UI**: Interface for selecting per-set color themes

### üì∏ Quick Image Testing:
- Drop images into `/public/images/sets/s001/`, `/s002/`, `/s003/` folders
- Naming: `banner.jpg`, `thumbnail.jpg`, `cards/c001.jpg`, etc.
- See folder README.md files for specific guidance
- Missing images automatically show placeholders

## Features

- **Netflix/Amazon Prime-style Homepage:**
    - Hero banner for featured content.
    - Horizontally scrollable rows for "Popular" and "Featured" quiz sets.
- **Static Data:** Fetches quiz data (creators, content sets, cards) from local JSON files in the `public/data` directory.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes (desktop and mobile).
- **Basic PWA Capabilities:** Includes a `manifest.json` and setup for service workers (via Create React App). Service worker registration is commented out by default in `src/index.js` but can be enabled.
- **Portuguese UI:** All user-facing strings are in Portuguese and managed for potential future i18n.
- **Routing:** Uses `HashRouter` for better compatibility with static hosting (especially GitHub Pages).
    - Homepage (`/`)
    - Content Set Detail Page (`/#/set/:setId`)
    - 404 Not Found Page
